# How to Run and Migrate the Database Table

Follow these steps to set up and migrate the database:
### You need to run these commands in every microservice apps in this directory

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Docker Containers
Run the following command to build and start your microservices:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Microservice Container Name
Once the containers are up, list the running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

Look for the container name of your microservice application (e.g., `wishlist-microservice-1`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Microservice Container
Replace `<CONTAINER-NAME>` with your actual microservice container name and run:

```sh
docker exec -it <CONTAINER-NAME> sh
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate and Apply Database Migrations
Inside the container, execute the following commands sequentially:

```sh
npm run generate
npm run push
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Database
To check if the tables have been created, connect to the database container:

```sh
docker exec -it <CONTAINER-NAME> psql -U postgres
```

Then, run:

```sql
\dt
```

This will list all the tables. If the expected tables are present, your API is ready to be used! üéâ
